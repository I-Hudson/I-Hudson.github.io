This project was created as I was interested in how to create random terrain within Unity using C#. This project was interesting and fun to as I was able to use the Mesh class within Unity which allowed me to directly change the properties of an objects mesh such as the vertices position.

The random terrain system can use either a height map or noise map as an input this allows flexibility of creating either a predictable map or a completely random map. The noise map system is generating a random noise with a seed value this allows you the change ether seed and get a different map altogether.
