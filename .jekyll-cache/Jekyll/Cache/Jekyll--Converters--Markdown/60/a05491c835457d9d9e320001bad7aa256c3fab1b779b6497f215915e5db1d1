I"x<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>This was my first large AAA project which I have worked on. My role was to work as a part of a small team to port Forza Horizon 4 from UWP (Universal Windows Platform) to Steam (Win64). This was a great experience as I was able to learn from a wide range of experienced programmers.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-did">What I did</h2>
<p>Some of the tasks that I was involved with were setting up rich presence for the Xbox game bar, helping with porting network code, minor UI changes and implementing DInput within the proprietary game engine.</p>

<h2 id="dinput">Dinput</h2>
<p>Adding Dinput into the game for wheel support was the biggest area I worked on. I enjoyed the challenge this gave me as well as the experience I was able to gain from it. This task allowed me to see into new areas of code which I had not seen before along with being able to see how internal systems such as input systems are implemented for multiple platforms.</p>

<p>There were some challenges from this task. The main one being I had never touched DInput before. With this challenge I went around it by not only referencing the documentation but also downloading and setting up some of the sample projects which are included with DX9.</p>

<p>Another challenge which came with this task was working in a large codebase. Previously I have only every worked in Unity projects which from my experience are a lot smaller and more manageable. This meant when adding DInput in I had to move from file to file often.</p>
