<p>Auto Video Editor is a small application with the purpose of removing frames which have a big difference between them such as when the camera is being panned around quickly.</p>

<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>The main challenge which came with this project was using a new 3rd party library, ffmpeg. This was because I have never used this library, or any image/video processing library with C++ before. It was an enjoyable challenge to overcome. I learnt about the library by reading through the example code which was provided which contained all the relevant steps I wanted for this project.</p>

for (int y = 0; y &lt; m_decCtx-&gt;height; y += prec)

		{
			uint8_t r = tempFrame-&gt;data[0][y * tempFrame-&gt;linesize[0] + x];
			uint8_t g = tempFrame-&gt;data[0][y * tempFrame-&gt;linesize[0] + x + 1];
			uint8_t b = tempFrame-&gt;data[0][y * tempFrame-&gt;linesize[0] + x + 2];

			rD += r / (double)255;
			gD += g / (double)255;
			bD += b / (double)255;
		}
	}

    // Normalise the red, green and blue values of the whole frame by the number of samplers taken.
	rD /= numSamples;
	gD /= numSamples;
	bD /= numSamples;

	if (a_compare)
	{
        // Get the difference between this frame and last frame.
		double rDiff = abs(rD - m_oldR);
		double gDiff = abs(gD - m_oldG);
		double bDiff = abs(bD - m_oldB);
		double diff = (rDiff + gDiff + bDiff) / 3;

		if (diff &lt; m_minDiff)
		{
			m_minDiff = diff;
		}
		else if (diff &gt; m_maxDiff)
		{
			m_maxDiff = diff;
		}

		m_avgDiff += diff;

		if (diff &gt; m_frameCompare)
		{
			result = true;
		}
	}
</pre>
Shown above is a code snippet of how two frames are compared. This will return a single double value which is then checked to see if it meets a threshold. If the different value is greater than the threshold then the frame is discarded.
