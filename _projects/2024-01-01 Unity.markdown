# About 
I worked on an unannounced package for the Unity game engine.

## What I did
I worked within a small team working on an unannounced package for the Unity game engine. In this role I was tasked with helping design a public API. This involved not only giving my opinion on what I believed to be the correct style for the API but also reviewing and collaborating with others over their ideas to find the best API for developers.

I worked within C# for developing the package while having to access platform specific C++ code for research on how underlying API worked. This gave me a great insight into how others saw the platform C++ code should be abstracted for use within a public API.

I was the first point of contract for a console platform within the team. This meant if there was any questions about my assigned platform it was my responsibility to give a clear and concise answer and when required to reach out to other members of the wide organisation. This meant that I was collaborating with a wide group of people from not only different teams but also locations.

<i>If you have any question or suggests about this project or any other project please do not hesitate to contract me.<i/>
