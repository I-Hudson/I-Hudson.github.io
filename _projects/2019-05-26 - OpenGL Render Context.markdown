# About 
The task for this project was to create a 3d scene which had to be rendered in real time using OpenGL and C++. 
The scene was required to include the following:
- A directional light with adjustable colour values
- A Point light with adjustable colour values and range/radius
- A Spotlight with adjustable colour values and adjustable inner and outer radius and range
- Shadow mapping
- Vertex shader animation
- Tessellation


## Challenges
This project produced many challenges. The biggest challenge was the lack of knowledge I have with OpengGL. This is due to this project being the first one where I was tasked with interactive with OpenGL directly. This meant I haf a step learning curve with this project. To over come this challenge I used reference materiel from the lectures to help grasp an understanding of OpenGL and used online resources to further my understanding.

<p>
This project has taught me much about how graphics are rendered and has given me a great appreciation for render engines. I hope to continue to work on this project in my free time and add more features like audio and materials.
